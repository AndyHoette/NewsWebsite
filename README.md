Creative Portion: For our creative portion we did a few things. First of all, all users have a personal profile page. This page allows them to create and then view their bio. It also tells the user how many stories they have created, and also allows you to view and edit the stories you have made.

Login Details: You should be able to make your own account if you please by navigating to the login page.
